## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape, ensuring the security and reliability of smart contracts is paramount. Through meticulous analysis and rigorous testing, I have conducted numerous audits to identify vulnerabilities, enhance contract robustness, and uphold the highest security standards. This portfolio encompasses three primary categories of my audit work:

- **First Flights**: Smart contract security audit contests written to simulate real-world protocols
- **Competitive Audits**: Evaluations performed in competitive environments to benchmark security measures.
- **Bug Bounties**: Analyses resulting from bug bounty programs aimed at uncovering and addressing vulnerabilities.


## Audit Categories

## Report Template

To assist others in creating structured and comprehensive security audit reports, I have provided a template that can be customized to suit individual needs. The template is located in the `Report Template` folder of this repository.

### How to Use the Template

1. **Access the Template**: Navigate to the `Report Template` folder in this repository to find the `report-example.md` file.
2. **Download**: You can download the specific file to your local machine for further customization.
3. **Customize**: Open the `report-example.md` file in any Markdown editor and modify the sections as per your requirements.
4. **Utilize**: Use the customized template to document your own security audit findings in a clear and organized manner.

By providing this template, I aim to promote consistency and thoroughness in the documentation of security audits within the community.

## Severity Classification

The severity of identified issues in the reports is classified as follows:

- **C (Critical)**: Severe vulnerabilities that could lead to significant security breaches or loss of funds.
- **H (High)**: High-impact issues that may compromise contract functionality or security.
- **M (Medium)**: Moderate vulnerabilities that could affect contract performance or user interactions.
- **L (Low)**: Low-impact issues with minimal security implications but worth addressing.
- **I (Informational)**: Observations and recommendations to improve code quality and best practices.
- **G (Gas Optimization)**: Suggestions aimed at enhancing the contract's efficiency and reducing gas costs.
